# Simon Game Project

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.
The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user/player to repeat the sequence.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. In normal mode the user repeats the round if the sequence is wrong. In strict mode the user starts from round 1 when the sequence is wrong. The game is over when the user completes 20 rounds.

## Getting Started

The project is hosted on Github pages https://bomafiber.github.io/simon_game/ and can be cloned via url https://github.com/bomafiber/simon_game.git

These steps below will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests


### Manual Testing

For this project I conducted the following types of testing:

* Functional testing
* Usability testing
* Cross browser testing

 The application was tested on following browsers(Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer). The application was also viewed and tested on  mobile devices.



### Automated Testing  

I used the Jasmine BDD framework for automated testing.

 1. Download the jasmine standalone distribution from Github https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/releases and extract the folders to your local machine. I used version 2.99.1 for my project. It had a few vulnerabilities but it worked for this purpose.

 2. Link your source file and spec files in the head of the **specRunner.html** file and then launch the **specRunner.html** in a browser.
